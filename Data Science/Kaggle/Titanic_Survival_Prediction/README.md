# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on features such as age, sex, class, and other factors.

## Steps Taken:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzed the dataset to understand the distribution and correlations of the features.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualized key features and their relationships with survival rates.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, scaled features, and encoded categorical variables.
- **Model Building and Evaluation**: Trained multiple models, tuned hyperparameters, and evaluated their performance based on accuracy.

### Models Used:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier

## Results:
- The model achieved the best accuracy using the Random Forest classifier with an accuracy of 86,94% after hyperparameter optimization.
